### About the Workshop
Scholars of African American experiences have long insisted that we shift perceptions about evidentiary privilege. Now, in tapping historical and contemporary humanities data, how do notions about evidence and recovery change when we reconsider what gets labeled “absent” or “present?” What are the advantages of meaning-making at the margins? From Colored Conventions to Ida B. Wells to the recent #SayHerName movement, subjects and figures once considered invisible are now core to varied approaches to studying the intersection of race, class, and gender.

Building on models in the field, this workshop aims to foster a community of scholars interested in developing digital projects in African American studies. We will do so by igniting a conversation about evidence and data that challenges popular ideas about obscurity and ubiquity connected to Black intellectual enterprises. Along the way, participants will also learn about practices in data curation, mapping, and text analysis. 

Join us as we gather at the Studio@Butler to examine three case studies. No previous experience in digital humanities is needed, but those with digital humanities experience at any level are welcomed.  

In this workshop participants will take up the questions about how digital methods can extend or reconstruct the ways that we have thought about, collected, and analyzed evidence. How do we interpret graphs, maps, and more to situate them within larger critical conversations about identity, technology, and evidentiary privilege, thereby transforming African American cultural studies as well as digital humanities?  

The workshop will be led by an interdisciplinary collective focused on nurturing and exploring humanist approaches to the documentation, preservation, and interpretation of African American history and culture.

Initial collaborators include: 
- Caitlin Pollock (Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis)
- Trevor Muñoz (African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities, University of Maryland)
- Katie Rawson (Emory University)
- Sarah Patterson (Colored Conventions Project, University of Massachusetts Amherst)
- Jim Casey (Colored Conventions Project, Princeton University)

### About the Case Studies 
The first case study investigates 19th century geographic data mapped in 21st century GIS applications and considers how modern technology obstructs and distorts data while visualizing while also providing a secondary perspective. This particular dataset is geographic data of lynching victims text mined from 19th century investigative reporter, Ida B. Wells's second anti-lynching pamphlet, A Red Record. A Red Record documents tabulations of lynchings from two years: 1893 and 1894. This case study will discuss the numerous layers between the user and the data, how digital methodologies of space and place may recreate an opportunity for the public consumption of Black death, and how can we avoid revictimization in datasets of violence and anguish.

The second case study unpacks 19th-century Black activist-intellectuals’ debates in numbers at the nexus of protest, labor and gender. Together, we’ll consider data drawn from two stand-out Colored Conventions held on both coasts of the US—in California and in Washington, D.C.—during the decade encompassing the American Civil War.

The third case study explores the way people on Twitter used the #SayHerName hashtag to “raise awareness for black female victims of police brutality and anti-Black violence in the United States.” How does a social media platform help change notions of evidence? How does treating the social media stream as evidence allow for new interpretations of the interplay between activism and state-sanctioned violence? For this workshop, we will approach the data (approximately 400,000 tweets collected between January and October 2016) as textual evidence that we can “mine,” attending to the affordances and dangers of such methods.
