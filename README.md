### About the Workshop
Scholars of African American experiences have long insisted that we shift perceptions about evidentiary privilege. Now, in tapping historical and contemporary humanities data, how do notions about evidence and recovery change when we reconsider what gets labeled “absent” or “present?” What are the advantages of meaning-making at the margins? From Colored Conventions to Ida B. Wells to the recent #SayHerName movement, subjects and figures once considered invisible are now core to varied approaches to studying the intersection of race, class, and gender.

Building on models in the field, this workshop aims to foster a community of scholars interested in developing digital projects in African American studies. We will do so by igniting a conversation about evidence and data that challenges popular ideas about obscurity and ubiquity connected to Black intellectual enterprises. Along the way, participants will also learn about practices in data curation, mapping, and text analysis. 

Join us as we gather at the Studio@Butler to examine three case studies. No previous experience in digital humanities is needed, but those with digital humanities experience at any level are welcomed.  

In this workshop participants will take up the questions about how digital methods can extend or reconstruct the ways that we have thought about, collected, and analyzed evidence. How do we interpret graphs, maps, and more to situate them within larger critical conversations about identity, technology, and evidentiary privilege, thereby transforming African American cultural studies as well as digital humanities?  

The workshop will be led by an interdisciplinary collective focused on nurturing and exploring humanist approaches to the documentation, preservation, and interpretation of African American history and culture.

Sarah Lynn Patterson teaches African American literature in the English department at UMass. She specializes in 19th-century African American literature, women writers, Black print culture, gender and morality studies and digital humanities. 

Jim Casey is a Perkins Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University. He is a co-founder and national co-director of the Colored Conventions Project. His research on the history of editors and his digital practices engage questions of collaboration, access, and collective expression.

Her research interests include the role of librarians in digital humanities research and pedagogy, Black digital humanities, and 19th century African American female activists.

Katie Rawson is the Humanities Librarian for English at Emory University. Her research explores how people build and share knowledge by tackling questions about texture in humanities data, possibilities and limits in computational text analysis, processes of collaborative making, and sensory ways of knowing.

Trevor Muñoz is the Interim Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology (MITH), Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the University of Maryland Libraries, and a co-PI of African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) initiative. His research interests include humanities approaches to data curation and the design and sustainability of interdisciplinary research collaborations.
